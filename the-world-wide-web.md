# The world wide web
### So, what is it?

> The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.

What does this really mean? Well, we all have or know what laptops and desktops are right? Those laptops and desktops have files and images on them many times. A website simplified, is really just a collection files, images, video and much more. These computers that websites sit on are accessible via the internet. So when you get on your computer or phone and type in something like Google, your computer or phone makes a request to another computer, what we call a server and based on the url, the computer will respond with the corresponding assets for that website. Many times, multiple websites will sit on one server and based on the url the server will know which assets to grab. There is much more to this but from a high level that is essentially what's going on and well get much more into that later on.
